# ModernWeb3App [WIP]

> The goal of the project is to create a dapp interacting with blockchain using : typescript, react, solidity and tailwindcss.
> The main focus here is the front part using TS, using context provider, and nice design with Tailwindcss.
> The blockchain part is bad. For better practice: follow other repository like Commown Shared Wallet (advanced) or DÃ©veloppeurEthereum from Alyra training
